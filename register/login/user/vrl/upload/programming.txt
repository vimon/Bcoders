Techopedia explains Programming

Programming language semantics and syntax are used when constructing an application. Thus, programming requires knowledge of application domains, algorithms and programming language expertise.

Programming language logic differs by developer. From a high level, good code can be evaluated with factors such as:

    Robustness: Focuses on program continuation capability, regardless of errors or incorrect data
    Reliability: Focuses on correct design and algorithm implementation
    Efficiency: Focuses on memory, hardware or other properties used to optimize programs
    Readability: Proper documentation and indentation availability, which provides insight to other program developers or designers
